> Our kid was born a month ago, time flies for those unaware. Hectic, yet fulfilling as we learn > to live with our son. Enjoy life as it is. No rush, no fret.
> Aim at perfection (achievement, on Quality, striking thought pg117) 
> Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable; however, they who > aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and > despondency make them give it up as unattainable.

> ## 210912 - Migrated everything into google docs/sheets
> A new workflow hit me just recently, having research documents separate from webdev blogs > would help to split up my work, and not be distracted by the constant need to perfect my codes.
> Hoping this would have me focus on the important job of achieving my goal, not simply coding > everything into a website.
> So currently my whole setup
> Htdocs - all webdev files and folder is under xampp folder
> Github - push all my working files onto github, act as a backup
> Google Drive - all researches, spreadsheet is on google cloud, easier for access and storage
> Projects/jobs files - saved on desktop and backup occasionally
> Important files - all saved in sd-card on the laptop, occasionally backup to harddisk

> 10x Developer? Forget that, just one thing at a time.
> Fireship taken the first place in my heart as one of the best webdev teacher on YouTube, been > going through plenty of knowledgeable videos on explaining things in quick succession with > pragmatic jokes inbetween. Also run through a tutorial on setting up WSL, basically running > both windows and linux at the same time, benefit in running linux tools and such, although I > still fresh and under utilizing linux atm.
> Web Development Setup Guide for Windows with Linux (WSL), a great guide on introducing me to > new tool, such as bashrc, zsh, how to install nvm/node/npm, git auth, git-cli and the linux SL > train.

> ## 210801 - Hilbert Curve & Maurer Rose

> ## 210727 - P5.js Setup
> Setup sketching stuff
> Setup P5.js and migrated the demo sketch from the starter template Using Parcel, TypeScript > with p5.js. Not using parcelJS, but still useful to know how to create the instances for p5js > and classes.
> Moved all sketches or experiements to JS-Playground, also discovered lazyload vue-router quirk > on classic JS: P5js cannot load with
> component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "js-playground" */ '../views/JsPlayground.vue')

> I did a thing, again. Only this time, everything in this thing.
> (insert markdown) It's easy getting all conceit in my own capabilities, just living > day-to-day, pass the day doing minimal work. I have multiple attempts in getting myself into > routine to learn new stuff, but always fall shorts after several updates. This might turn out > the same, but I'm going to give this a try: working on this folder and solving whatever I need > using just this project. See how far I can go.
> For example this post right here, is done using hardcode via vuejs, and eventually I hope to > have this post generated through a proper API or CMS.
