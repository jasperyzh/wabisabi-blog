# The Pragmatic Programmer Tips

1. its your life - Care About Your Craft
2. Think! About Your Work - ongoing critical appraisal of every decision
3. You Have Agency
4. be responsible - Provide Options, Don't make Lame Excuses
5. avoid software rot/ technical debt - Don't live with broken windows, and avoid collateral damage
6. Be a catalyst for change - start-up fatigue
7. remember the Big Picture
8. Make Quality a Requirements Issue
9. Invest Regularly in your Knowledge Portfolio
   1.  Learn at least one new language every year

    7.  Be a listener
    8.  Get back to people
    9.  keep code and Documentation together.
12. It's both what you say and the way you say it
13. Build documentation in, don't bolt it on
14. Good design is easier to change than bad design
    1.  ETC principle (Easier to Change)
15. DRY - Don't repeat yourself
    1.  Duplication in Code
    2.  Duplication in Documentation
    3.  Representational Duplication (Internal/Exernal APIs)
    4.  Interdeveloper duplication
16. Make it easy to reuse
17. Orthogonality - Eliminate effects between unrelated things (Gain productivity & Reduce Risk)
    1.  Coding
        1.  Keep your code decoupled
        2.  Avoid global data
        3.  Avoid similar functions
    2.  Testing
    3.  Documentation
    4.  Living with Orthogonality
18. There are no final decisions
19. Forgo following Fads
20. Use tracer bullets to find the target (MVP-minimal viable product)
    1.  Users get to see something working early
    2.  Developers build a structure to work in
    3.  You have an integration platform
    4.  You have something to demonstrate
    5.  You have a better feel for progress
21. Prototype to learn; ignore correctness, completeness, robustness, style
22. Program close to the problem domain
23. Estimate to avoid surprises
    1.  Where dp estimates come from?
        1.  Understand what's being asked
        2.  Build a model of the system
        3.  break the model into components
        4.  give each parameter a value
        5.  calculate the answers
        6.  keep track of your estimating prowess
    2.  Estimating project schedules
        1.  PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) - optimistic/pessimistic scenario
        2.  Check requirements
        3.  Analyze risk (and prioritize riskiest items earlier)
        4.  Design, implement, integrate
        5.  Validate with the users
24. Iterate the schedule with the code
25. Keep knowledge in plain text
    1.  insurance against obsolescence
    2.  leverage existing tools
    3.  easier testing
26. Use the power of command shells
    1.  Set color themes
    2.  configuring a prompt - shortened current directory name, version control status, time
    3.  aliases and shell functions - shortcut repeating task, add prompt to rm
    4.  command completion - configure shell to recognize the tab shortcuts
27. Achieve editor fluency
    1.  When editing text, move and make selections by character, word, line, and paragraph
    2.  When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules, …).
    3.  Reindent code following changes.
    4.  Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command.
    5.  Undo and redo changes.
    6.  Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them.
    7.  Navigate to a particular line number.
    8.  Sort selected lines.
    9.  Search for both strings and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches.
    10. Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.
    11. Display compilation errors in the current project.
    12. Run the current project’s tests.
28. Always use version control
    1. all user preferences and dotfiles
    2. editor configuration
    3. list of software installed using homebrew
    4. the ansible script used to configure apps
    5. all current projects
29. Fix the problem, not the blame
30. Don't panic
31. Failing test before fixing code
32. Read the damn error message
33. "Select" isn't broken - if you see hoof prints, think horses—not zebras
34. Don't assume it - prove it
35. Learn a text manipulation language - awk; sek; python; ruby
36. You can't write perfect software
37. Design with Contracts (revise needed*)
    1.  Preconditions - what must be true in order for the routine to be called
    2.  Postconditions - what the routine is guaranteed to do
    3.  class invariants
    4.  DBC and Test-Driven Development - unit testing, test-driven development (TDD), property-based testing, or defensive programming
38. Crash early
39. Use assertion to prevent the impossible
40. Finish what you start
41. Act locally
42. Take small steps - always

100. It's your life. Share it. Celebrate it. Build it. AND HAVE FUN!

## Knowledge portfolios
1. Serious investors *invest regularly* - as a habit.
2. *Diversification* is the key to long-term success. - invest even in non-technical areas
3. Smart investors *balance their portfolios* between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. - like undervalued stock, learning new tech may have it returns.
5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically - check on the "to-do" list
